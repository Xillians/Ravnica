## Holidays

**28 Zuun  - Annual celebration of the guild pact.**

This festivity is a celebration of a full year past. Generally it is looked
upon as a day of peace between the guilds.

**4 Dhazo - Congregation at Dawn day.**

This Selesnyan holiday is usually celebrated by Vitu-Ghazi as a way to
celebrate the arrival of spring and the blooming of nature in the grand city.

**Rauck-Chauv:**

The Gruul have a holiday of sorts that they call 'Rauck-Chauv'. While it
might look like an excuse to simply wreck things, it's a really effective way
to lift their spirit while crushing the spirits of other guilds. Named after
a two-headed leader of the first Ghor clan, it occurs, coincedentally, on
other holidays that other guilds celebrate. It's "Congregation at Dawn" day
at Vitu-Ghazi? Rauck-Chauv! Just shout the words and let the Gruul
"festivities" begin! Disrupting ceremonies, crashing feasts, burning the place
down. A truly successful Rauck-Chauv cannot be fully appreciated until one year
later, when the enemy holiday ends up scaled down, held in secret, or
canceled altogether.
