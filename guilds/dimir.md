### Feature

**False identity:**

You have more than one identity. The one you wear most of the time makes you appear to be a member of a guild other than House Dimir. You have documentation, established acquaintances, and disguises that allow you to assume that persona and fit into the secondary guild. Whenever you choose, you can drop this identity and blend into the guildless masses of the city.

Consider why you're embedded in the secondary guild. Create a story with your DM, inspired by rolling the following table or choosing a reason that suits you.

| **d8**  | **reason for infiltration**
|  1      | My parents belong to this guild, and I let them think I'm following in their footsteps.
|  2      | I've been assigned to track this guild's activities.
|  3      | I've been assigned to get close to an individual in this guild and learn their secrets.
|  4      | I've been assigned to recruit a new Dimir spy from the ranks of this guild.
|  5      | I was a member of this guild before the Dimir recruited me.
|  6      | I don't like what this guild stands for and want to destroy it from within.
|  7      | I secretly wish I could leave the Dimir and join this guild, but there is no escaping the Dimir.
|  8      | I chose this guild at random or on a lark.

### Dimir contacts

As an agent of House Dimir working undercover, you have limited contacts
within your guild. Your relationships with your secondary guild, in the guise
of your false identity, are usually more extensive.

Roll once on the Dimir contacts table, giving you an ally who serves as your
contact in Dimir. Then roll twice on the table for your secondary guild.
The first roll gives you an ally there, and the second roll gives you a rival.

| **d8** | **Contact** |
| ------ | ----------- |
| 1      |
| 2      |
| 3      |
| 4      |
| 5      |
| 6      |
