### Azorius guild spells

| **Spell level** | **Spells** |
| --------------- | -----------|
| cantrip         | friends, message
| 1st             | command, ensnaring strike
| 2nd             | arcane lock, calm emotions, hold person

| 4th             | compulsion, divination
| 5th             | dominate person

Your magic often takes the form of blue or golden runes  floating and glowing
in the air in circular patterns or shimmering azure barriers of magical energy.
If you cast ensnaring strike, for example, the vines created by the spell
might appear as rune-inscribed glowing bands that wrap around the target
and hold it in place.

### Suggested characteristics

People from the Azorius senate tend toward a demeanor of cold dignity
and pragmatic, orderly nature. Steeped in the law as they are, their ideals and
priorities revolve around legal issues of the city.

### Contacts

The Azorius is a sprawling bureaucracy, and people in a variety of positions
throughout the guiuld can pull strings to make things happen. Because of the
guild's role in making and enforcing laws for the entire city, your place in
the Senate can easily bring you to contact with members of other guilds, for
good and ill. Roll twice on the **Azorius Contacts** table (once for ally,
and once for a rival) and once on the **Non-Azorius contacts** table.
